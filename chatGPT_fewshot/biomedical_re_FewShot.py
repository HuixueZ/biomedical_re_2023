        "4. INHIBITOR: CEM that binds to a GPRO (typically a protein) and decreases its activity. \n"
        "5. MODULATOR: CEM that acts as allosteric modulator, compound that increases or decreases the action of an (primary or orthosteric) agonist or antagonist by combining with a distinct (allosteric or allotropic) site on the receptor macromolecule. If no information is available on whether the CEM activates or reduces GPRO activity, this general subclass should be assigned. \n"
